## Functions

### Tracking Moving Centroids (TMC)

* **tmc.m**: compute the cenroids clusters of fish tracks using SOM.

* **visualize_tmc.m**: plot the centroid clusters generated from tmc.m and their shift.

### Aggregating Moving Clusters (AMC)

* **amc.m**: compute the surface baf area of moving clusters with SOM.

* **visualize_amc_bagplot.m**: visualize bagplots of moving clusters at specific timestamps.

### Tracking Fish Mobility (TFM). 

* **tfm.m**: tracking of fish mobility between moving clusters
